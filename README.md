# VR-Graduation

This repository is for the Virtual Commencement of Carnegie Mellon University's Entertainment Technology Center (CMUETC), Class of 2020.

## Environment

This experience is developed using:
- VRChat SDK3 (VRCSDK3): I understand that VRCSDK3 is just fresh out of the oven, but since it promises advanced action programming rather than just triggers, I figure that it's a reasonable risk to take. Plus, we aren't creating avatars in this world, are we?
- Unity 2018.4.20f1: **For people who'd like to develop on this project, it is imperative that you use this version**, as stated in the official documentation.

## Optional Tools
- Sourcetree (neat Git GUI)
- Visual Studio Code

## Guidelines
- Branch out from master if you want to add / modify anything.
- Highly recommend the use of prefabs.
Avoids a lot of merging conflicts in later steps.
- Please use pull request first before you merge into master. Keep the master clean!

## Additional Resource
- VRChat SDK documentation: https://docs.vrchat.com/

## Final Notes
Thank you for helping us develop this project! Graduation is near, so let's push this thing to completion together!
